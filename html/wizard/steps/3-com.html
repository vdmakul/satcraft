    Communication system

    A satellite that has no way of communication with earth is a pretty useless satellite, no different than space-junk. The choice of a COM subsystem depends on your power budget and what type of data you send and recieve from your satellite: if you only need to read a couple of sensor you dont need a very fast COM but if you want to send video from your satellite you need a fast COM subsystem.
